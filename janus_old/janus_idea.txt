I want to create a system similar to quickbooks but for manufacturers and distributors. So basically when a user wants to acees the web app, they either register as a manufacturer, distributor, both, or through an invite link if they are a member of an already registered company in the system. For now we will start with creating a system for manufacturers then we will move on to the distributor. There will be roles for users belonging to a certain company. Lets say managerial, supervisor, employees(sales), employee(production) So there will be restrictions as to what each user can access, of course with the managerial  accessing everything. The interface should be nearly identical to quickbooks, however I will provide the ui for each page or guide you on how I want it to be. So for the sales side it will be the same for both manufacturers and distributors, the following forms will be used: sales receipt, invoice, refund receipt, credit note, receive payment, statement, estimate. On the purchase side, for manufactures there will be mainly goods that will be used in the production process maybe raw materials, packaging, repairs, machinery etc, each manufacturer in the system can choose his own purchases, so the forms here will be Expenses, bill, supplier credit, purchase order etc, am not really sure how this will be, feel free to research maybe other manufacturing systems and let me know. Also for the forms I will provide the ui designs. 
What will stand out in this system compared to others is the high level analytics that it will provide and also if I can have ai in the system, am not sure if it will be an ai agent or a chatbot, but something that can have access to the db and answer questions for the user, of course it should only have access to the db where it only sees data for that company and not for all, so we will need to ensure itdoes not see everything as am sure some one can trick it to reveal all the info for all companies. Also if you have any other cool unique features you think will give us a competitive edge in the market please let me know and we can discuss about it. 

So for backend am thinking supabase that will simplify the authentication, handle database and storage. for frontend next.js. Am am  data analyst so all these stuff is new to me so I will learn as I go. So make sure to teach me as we go as well. I also need the project broken down into parts such that incase there is an issue/bug I can easily pinpoint it, I want simple and functional and optimized code in short files. High level documentation for each section of the project in read me and in code. My plan is to have this project super optimized so I don’t have performance issues when rolling out to customers. So in situations that need caching, improve speed and performance where a lot of people can be using the system without experiencing delays or server failure please implement them. Also you will be providing me with the sql for the tables I need to create in supabase as you teach me. Like do I need to use RLS? Etc.
Another thing I want to self host any open source software that is needed in this project like supabase etc. this way it will be easy when transitioning this project from running in my local computer to a server. Also we will use docker and kubernetes if needed. Another thing is I want the project to be in github such that there is development branch where code is tested before moving it to production in the main branch. So am not sure how this is going to be but I depend on you to get creative with it and work wonders. So the plan it to have the project run locally in my machine then when I make progress ill move to a server.
To begin maybe we can have a frontend and backend folder. For now we can go for a simple functional ui then you can fine tune it to the project and make sure it works well and data is saved to supabase. As well as making sure the process and code are optimized, simple functional and short files for easy debugging. If we will use api endpoints you can teach me on how they work and maybe even show me how to use swagger and all that. Once we have the authentication, login signup stuff done and the landing page once you login as well as a few forms lets say invoice working then we can have it run on docker test how it works. Then push the project to github and set up the CI/CD, development branch so that from then when we make changes we test it out in development before pushing to production. If you want we can first brainstorm on this idea, let me know what you think, go deep to the neety greeties of the functionalities, features, challenges that we are to face, possible solutions etc I know I might have missed a lot but that’s why I need your help so I can get a bigger picture of what am going into. 


Process (Manufacturer): 
1. Purchase
- Purchase Order Form
- Purchase Form - to record received goods that have been bought
- Supplier credit form
- Supplier Refund form
2.Production
- Production Record Form
3.Packaging 
- Packaging Record Form
4.Transport(this is when finished goods are maybe moved from the factory store to a different store or just from one store to another. This is not transport for selling goods)
- Transport Record Form
5.Store/Warehouse
- No form here, maybe analytics of what was brought or removed and what is in the store at the moment. Things that are about to expire or have expired, things that are low and need restocking etc
- since this should be automatic, here the store clerk/supervisor should have the ability to check/confirm if products have really arrived in the store or exited for sale or whatever.
-  this will handle both raw material stock and finished product stock.
- maybe we can have a form to reconcile stuff just incase something is not adding up in the store and they have completely failed to account for it so we don’t carry forward the problem forever. However this should be recorded as reconsiled  or something.
6.Sales
- Invoice Form
- Sales Receipt Form
- Refund Receipt Form
- Credit note Form
- Statement Form
- Estimate Form
- Receive Payment Form

Alternatively if the amount received field is filled directly that amount is distributed to the unpaid invoices in the table in that the oldest invoice open balance is cleared, then the remaining goes as payment for the next oldest invoice etc.

Role based. I want this system to be like modules in that the admin can give different roles permissions or remove permission at will.
So the roles will be like this:
Owner(which will basically be me who is creating)
Admin - these will be the managerial team of my client companies they will have access to everything 
Sales Supervisor
Sales rep
Procurement Supervisor
Procurement rep
Production Supervisor
Machine Operator
Packaging Supervisor
Packaging person
Transport Supervisor
Transport person
Store Supervisor
Store person
Hr Supervisor - this we will add employee stuff later
- A person can have multiple roles. Then the admin can decide the permissions what each category gets.

What do you think of this? Any easier way to handle the roles? Any improvements you have in mind.
